# Instructions

Develop a webApi to make the test script located in the test directory to pass. You can not modify the tests, your solution has to make these test pass as they are.

You can use any of these languages to develop your solution: JavaScript, Java, CSharp, Python, Ruby, Groovy, Smalltalk or Php. If you prefer to use something different please check with us before starting.

To run the test script you will need to:

1. Install Node JS (version 8, check the corresponding installation procedure for your OS)
2. Install dependencies by executing _npm Install_
3. Run tests be execting _npm test_

Once you have completed the solution, please zip it and upload it to GDrive/Dropbox. 
The zip file must be named with the following pattern: name-bootcamp-exercise.zip (where "name" must be replaced with your name. For example juanperez-bootcamp-exercise.zip)

Then share it with us by sending an email to eng.bootcamp@auth0.com including the link to the uploaded zip file and setting the subject of the email to "Bootcamp exercise".
